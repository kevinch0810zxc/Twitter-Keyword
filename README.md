## What is this App
This Shiny App allows you to search for tweets that contain a certain keyword of your choice. Then it will display the sentiment scores of those tweets, and a wordcloud that shows you the words most frequently used along with your keyword.

There are two versions of this app: **Basic Search** and **Advanced Search**. The primary difference is that Basic Search will grab only the newest tweets (within the date range that you can specify), while Advanced Search will take X number of tweets from each day and make a boxplot instead of a scatter plot.
